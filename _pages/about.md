I am a mathematician specialising in category theory.  I have a range of research interests including coherence issues in low dimensional category theory, relations to foundations and logic, homotopical universal properties, and the formal theory of pseudomonads. More recently I have been thinking about two-dimensional categorical models of linear and differential logic.
