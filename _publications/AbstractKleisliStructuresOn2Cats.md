excerpt: 'Fuhrmann introduced Abstract Kleisli structures to model call-by-value programming languages with side effects, and showed that they correspond to monads satisfying a certain equalising condition on the unit. We first extend this theory to non-strict morphisms of monads, and to incorporate $2$-cells of monads. We then further extend this to a theory of abstract Kleisli structures on $2$-categories, characterising when the original pseudomonad can be recovered by the abstract Kleisli structure on its $2$-category of free-pseudoalgebras.'
