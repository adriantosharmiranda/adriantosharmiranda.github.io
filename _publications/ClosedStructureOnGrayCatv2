title: "A semi-strictly generated closed structure on $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ClosedStructureOnGrayCat
excerpt: 'Although semi-strict trinatural transformations are not closed under composition, once they are closed under composition they form the morphisms of internal homs $[\mathfak{A},\mathfrak{B}]$ of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$. These internal homs indeed form part of a closed structure on $\mathbf{Gray}$-$\mathbf{Cat}$'
