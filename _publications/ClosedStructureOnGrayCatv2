excerpt: 'Although semi-strict trinatural transformations are not closed under composition, once they are closed under composition they form the morphisms of internal homs $\mathfak{A},\mathfrak{B}$ of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$. These internal homs indeed form part of a closed structure on $\mathbf{Gray}$-$\mathbf{Cat}$'

We show that the semi-strictly generated internal homs of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories $[\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B}]_\text{ssg}$ defined in previous work underlie a closed structure on the category $\mathbf{Gray}$-$\mathbf{Cat}$ of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories and $\mathbf{Gray}$-functors. The morphisms of $[\mathfrak{A},\mathfrak{B}]_\text{ssg}$ are composites of those trinatural transformations which satisfy the unit and composition conditions for pseudonatural transformations on the nose rather than up to an invertible $3$-cell. Such trinatural transformations leverage three-dimensional strictification while overcoming the challenges posed by failure of middle four interchange to hold in $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories. As a result we obtain a closed structure that is only partially monoidal with respect to Crans'. As a corollary we obtain a slight strengthening of strictification results for braided monoidal bicategories, which will be improved further in a forthcoming paper.
