excerpt: 'This paper studies particular well-behaved strictification constructions in low dimensions n âˆˆ {2,3}. Specifically, any bicategory (resp. tricategory) is biequivalent (resp. triequivalent) to a 2-category (resp. Gray-category) whose underlying category (resp. sesquicategory) is free on a graph (resp. 2-computad). We examine how the resulting freeness in codimension one of the strictified structure informs how the strictification construction extends to weak maps between higher categories, in which the usual functoriality or naturality axioms hold up to suitable equivalences.'

Weak structures abound in higher category theory, but are often suitably equivalent to stricter structures that are easier to understand. We extend strictification for tricategories and trihomomorphisms to trinatural transformations, trimodifications and perturbations. Along the way we distinguish between the operational coherences, which are possible to strictify, and the coherences on globular inputs, which remain weak. We introduce generalised path objects for $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories, which help reduce proofs in the three-dimensional setting to known results. Upon closing the resulting semi-strict trinatural transformations under composition, we state the hom-triequivalences of what we expect to be a `semi-strictification tetra-adjunction'.
