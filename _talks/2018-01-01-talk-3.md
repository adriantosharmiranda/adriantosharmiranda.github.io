I have regularly contributed talks, and filled in to host the seminar on occasion. A selected list of abstracts from talks that I have given is available at [Australian Category Theory Seminar Speaker Information- Adrian Miranda](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/groups/coact/seminar/cgi-bin/speaker-info.cgi?name=Adrian+Miranda)
