I actively participate in local research seminars on diverse topics such as differential geometry, algebra, and semigroup theory. I have also contributed two talks to the logic seminar, including an invited talk on my research on two-dimensional categorical models of linear logic [Events at University of Manchester- Logic Seminar](https://events.manchester.ac.uk/event/event:o225-lnivzo4w-z0y4i6/logic-seminaradrian-miranda-manchester)
